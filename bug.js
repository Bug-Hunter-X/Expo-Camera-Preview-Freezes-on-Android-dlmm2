This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with certain Android devices. The camera preview freezes or displays a black screen after a short period. This is especially noticeable when using the camera continuously, like in a video recording scenario. The error isn't consistently reproducible and doesn't provide specific error logs, making debugging difficult. It's also specific to Expo managed workflow and does not appear when building a bare workflow app.
